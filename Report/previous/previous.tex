\section{Previous Work}
In \cite{Kapre}, \textit{Kapre} has proposed an FPGA accelerator for parallelizing
the sparse matrix phase of the open-source Spice3f5 circuit simulator. The acceleration
hass been achieved by utilizing the symbolic analysis step of the KLU solver to generate
the data flow graph. This graph is then mapped to the network of processing elements 
connected in Mesh grid. \\
More recently Tarek Nechma and Mark Zwolinski \cite{Nechma} have presented the similar approach to 
leverage medium-grain parallelism for LU decomposition based on the column
based parallelism present in the Gilbert-Peierls Algorithm. The architecture 
prepares a column execution schedule using the sysmbolic analysis and maps the
computation of each column to processing element consisting a MAC unit, divider unit
and BRAM. Individual column operations are scheduled using ASAP method. The columns 
are loaded from the main memory with the help of column buffers which is similar to
the DMA engine. Each PE computes the column and then sends updates to the main memory.\\
