\begin{Abstract}
\noindent
Solving the sparse linear system is one of the most critical steps in many 
scientific applications such as circuit simulation, power system modeling, 
and computer vision. These operations, especially circuit simulations, are iterative 
in nature and require tens of thousands of sparse system solves. The circuit simulation 
consists of two phases per iteration: model evaluation followed by asymmetric sparse linear system solve. 
The model evaluation phase is highly parallelizable unlike the subsequent phase, 
which involves highly sparse and circuit dependent asymmetric matrices. The 
project presents a scalable FPGA based LU solver system geared towards the 
matrices that arise in circuit simulations. 
The project leverages the fact that the structure of the sparse system remain 
the same during the entire simulation and hence can be analyzed symbolically 
only once to generate an execution schedule and use it for further iterations.
The project integrates static pivoting and symbolic analysis to generate task graph which is the 
scheduled using the priority list based ASAP strategy. The software toolchain 
also provides option to generate and synthesize the required hardware.
